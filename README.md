# Netflix Dataset Classification

A data mining project using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Follows the KDD process with data preprocessing and classification using DT, SVM, KNN, and NB. Includes training/testing split and cross-validation for performance evaluation.

## Project Overview
This project performs classification on the Netflix dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook. It follows the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, including data preprocessing, handling missing values and duplicates, and applying four classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The dataset is split into training and testing sets using cross-validation for performance evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitjavia/netflix-movie-rating-dataset)

## How to Run
1. Open the `Netflix_dataset_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
2. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.  
3. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib).
